                        <h2>Game Development</h2>

                        <p>I started making games since 2013 after coming across the <i><a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity Game Engine</a></i>. Since then, I have taken part in various online and offline game jams and creating and testing prototypes to check what works and what doeto check what works and what doesn't. One of <a href="https://youtu.be/PZn9a9-Gyc0" target="_blank">Rami Ismail's talk to indie startups</a> made me expand my interests, by realising the importance of game design, on how a game with great artwork and technical implementations will fall flat if it doesn't have a proper design. As a designer, I come up with game mechanics based on my restrictions while still keeping it enjoyable and as a programmer I quickly prototype and test the mechanics to make it interesting.</p>

                        <h2>Open Source Contribution</h2>
                        <p>My journey with open source began with <a href="http://jasonpark.me" target="_blank">Jason Park</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/parkjs814/AlgorithmVisualizer" target="_blank">Algorithm Visualizer</a>, which was a huge learning experience for me. Since then, I open sourced most of my <a href="/browse/">personal projects</a> and wanted to learn more about it. Keeping that in mind, I started contributing to KDE's projects, which specifically interested me. Eventually I was selected as a Google Summer of Code student under KDE in 2017 and the experience has been overwhelming. This also lead me to start an open source community in our college, named <a href="http://bytesclub.github.io/">Bytes Club</a>, where we encourage newcomers to take part in open source contribution.</p>
