			<p> Most of my time is spent on video game programming and design. Most of my design is somehow or the other inspired by most of the design related talks mentioned in the <a href="/talks/" >talks I found interesting</a> page. Most experimental games are available in <a href="https://rudra.itch.io/">itch.io</a> and <a href = "https://gamejolt.com/@r_n_b">gamejolt</a>. </p>

                        <h2>Game Development</h2>

                        <p>I started making games since 2013 after coming across the <i><a href="https://unity3d.com/" target="_blank">Unity Game Engine</a></i>. Since then, I have taken part in various online and offline game jams and creating and testing prototypes to check what works and what doeto check what works and what doesn't. One of <a href="https://youtu.be/PZn9a9-Gyc0" target="_blank">Rami Ismail's talk to indie startups</a> made me expand my interests, by realising the importance of game design, on how a game with great artwork and technical implementations will fall flat if it doesn't have a proper design. As a designer, I come up with game mechanics based on my restrictions while still keeping it enjoyable and as a programmer I quickly prototype and test the mechanics to make it interesting.</p>

                        <h2>Open Source Contribution</h2>
                        <p>My journey with open source began with <a href="http://jasonpark.me" target="_blank">Jason Park</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/parkjs814/AlgorithmVisualizer" target="_blank">Algorithm Visualizer</a>, which was a huge learning experience for me. Since then, I open sourced most of my <a href="/browse/">personal projects</a> and wanted to learn more about it. Keeping that in mind, I started contributing to KDE's projects, which specifically interested me. Eventually I was selected as a Google Summer of Code student under KDE in 2017 and the experience has been overwhelming. This also lead me to start an open source community in our college, named <a href="http://bytesclub.github.io/">Bytes Club</a>, where we encourage newcomers to take part in open source contribution.</p>
