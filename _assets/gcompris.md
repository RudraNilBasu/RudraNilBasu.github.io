GCompris is a high quality educational software suite, including a large number of activities for children aged 2 to 10. Some of the activities are game orientated, but nonetheless still educational.

Currently GCompris offers in excess of 100 activities and more are being developed. GCompris is free software, that means that you can use it as you wish, adapt it to your own needs, improve it, and, most importantly, share it with everyone.

This version is a full rewrite of GCompris using the QtQuick technology. It is developed within the KDE community and is part of the GNU Project.

### My Role

As a Google Summer of Code student, I was responsible for adding three new activities for GCompris: 

* Submarine: Which aims at creating a simulation of a submarine using [box2d](http://box2d.org/).
* Family: To 
* Digital Electricity: A simulation of digital electric circuit.
