*Chalk* is a command line text editor written in C. For documentation, we are using [Sphinx](https://pythonhosted.org/an_example_pypi_project/sphinx.html).

### My Role

My role is divided into two parts:
* **Developer**: As a developer, I work on implementing new features along with the community.
* **Maintainer**: As a maintainer, I accept and review patches, and discuss the overall goal and direction of the project.
